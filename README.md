# python_snake

This is a Snake game made with [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-373/) and [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/ "Pygame's Homepage").

## About this project

I made this project for school assingment and to learn how OOP works in Python. I am pretty much a noob with Python, so I thought that making a basic Snake-game would be a fun way to learn the language, and it really was. I tried my best to make the code as readable as possible, and the best info about the code you can get by reading the comments in the [snake.py-file](https://github.com/Intomies/python_snake/blob/master/snake.py). 

I also made a couple of [releases](https://github.com/Intomies/python_snake/releases) along the way, so if you want, you can check those out and see how the code evolved.

There is also [NOTES.md-file](https://github.com/Intomies/python_snake/blob/master/notes/NOTES.md) included in the repo, which is meant for the teacher. It contains the Git-history of this project.

I compiled the game with [PyInstaller](https://pypi.org/project/PyInstaller/) to be excecutable. Executable version is contained in [snake.rar](https://github.com/Intomies/python_snake/blob/master/snake.rar). Rar contains all the files needed to play, just unpack it and use the snake.exe to start the game. I know the compiled version is pretty awkward, but it works. I also will delete the rar from this repo when the course is over.

If you want to run the game via command line/editor, you need to pull [snake.py](https://github.com/Intomies/python_snake/blob/master/snake.py)-file. You can also pull the [hs.txt](https://github.com/Intomies/python_snake/blob/master/hs.txt)-file, which contains the highscore, but this is not necessary. If you dont pull hs.txt, snake.py-file will create it for you on first run, because without this file the game will crash.
